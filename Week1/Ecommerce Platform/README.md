# Exercise 3 – E-commerce Platform Search Function

## Objective
Implement linear and binary search algorithms for finding products on an e-commerce platform and compare their performance.

## Description
This Java project defines a `Product` class with fields like `productId`, `productName`, and `category`.  
It demonstrates:
- Linear search (unsorted array)
- Binary search (sorted array)
- Searching by ID and by name

## Files
- `Product.java` – Model class for products
- `LinearSearch.java` – Performs linear search
- `BinarySearch.java` – Performs binary search
- `ProductSearchUtils.java` – Utility for displaying products
- `Main.java` – Executes the search operations and shows results

## Output
Displays the list of products, search results using linear and binary methods, and confirms the correct product match.

## Time Complexity
- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n)
