# Exercise 4 – Financial Forecasting

## Objective
Use recursion to build a financial forecast tool that projects future value based on an initial investment and annual growth rate.

## Description
This Java project uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the future value of an investment over a number of years. It prints the projected amount for each year.

## Files
- `FinancialForecast.java` – Contains the recursive method
- `ForecastUtil.java` – Utility to print forecast values
- `Main.java` – Main class to run the tool

## Output
Displays the future value for each year based on the initial amount and growth rate.

## Time Complexity
- Recursive forecast: O(n)
- Efficient and easy to understand recursion for simple annual projection
